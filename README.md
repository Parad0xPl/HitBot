# Hitbot
Electron self-hosted bot for HitBox\[Rest in peace, the most incredible 
streaming platform\]. It was never ready for actual usage, but it was a fun 
project to learn, and I found that the platform's authors left the color 
variables unrestricted so users could pass any color - even the same as the 
background.
